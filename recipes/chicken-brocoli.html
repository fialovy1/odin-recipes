    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The dish is prepared by stir frying blanched broccoli florets and seared pieces of chicken breast. The chicken is often velveted to tenderize it. The stir 
        fry typically includes a "brown sauce" made with oyster sauce, soy sauce, ginger, garlic and Shaoxing wine.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saut√© pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts, and season with a generous pinch of salt 
                and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is browned and mostly cooked through.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, make your sauce. (See below.)</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is browned, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and broccoli, and stir to combine. Continue cooking for an additional 3 minutes, until the broccoli is bright green. Stir in the sauce, and cook for an 
                additional 1 minute until the sauce has thickened.  Remove from heat and stir in the sesame oil until combined.</li>
            <li>Serve warm, garnished with green onions and toasted sesame seeds.  Or transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.</li>
